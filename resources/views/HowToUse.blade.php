                <p>Welcome to Critters by RoguDev</p>
                <p>In this project, you'll take on the role of a field researcher discovering various creatures known as
                    Critters. Your role as a researcher is to publish these creatures in the Crittopedia.</p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Registration:</strong> To become a researcher, simply register as a user. Click on "Sign
                        Up" and follow the prompts to create your account.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Publishing a Critter</h2>

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li><strong>Registering a Critter:</strong> Once registered, navigate to the "Register a Critter"
                        section. Fill out the form with details about the Critter you've encountered. Don't worry if you
                        make a mistake; you can edit your entry later in the "My Registrations" section.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uploading Media:</strong> You can upload an image and sound of the Critter. Please note
                        there are file size limits for these uploads.</li>
                </ul>

                        the "Use Crittopedia" section.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Managing Your Profile</h2>
